To quantify the processability of Additive Manufacturing, [Brika et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2019.100929) introduced a metric known as the Additive Manufacturing Suitability (AMS) factor, which is defined as:

In this equation, all parameters are normalized according to their maximum values among all tested powders. Notably, the CBD is multiplicatively inversed and then normalized. It is also crucial to emphasize that while each parameter in Equation 1 holds an equal weight of 1/7, adjusting the weighting factors can offer advantages in different scenarios [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.07.026).
