## Additive Manufacturing Suitability Factor

This research focuses on creating a unified methodology for comparing two or more powders of similar materials based on specific parameters. The method is implemented in [Jupyter + Python](https://github.com/yanicen1/Additive-Manufacturing-Suitability-Factor/blob/4c3d5f8a8449e30a3c611a0b5377d3ccc476a5b9/AMSF.ipynb) or [MS Excel](https://github.com/yanicen1/Additive-Manufacturing-Suitability-Factor/blob/4c3d5f8a8449e30a3c611a0b5377d3ccc476a5b9/AMSF.xlsx) software.

All used libraries were saved in files [requirements.txt](https://github.com/yanicen1/Additive-Manufacturing-Suitability-Factor/blob/8a81c3b342c34bb39dda704d5b840af72d43fae8/requirements.txt) and [environment.yaml](https://github.com/yanicen1/Additive-Manufacturing-Suitability-Factor/blob/8a81c3b342c34bb39dda704d5b840af72d43fae8/environment.yml) for conda.
